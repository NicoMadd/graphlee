# Workflee

---

## Description

**Graphlee** is a Graph tool which its main purpose is to give support to **Workflee** as the graph tool under the hood. There are many excellent tools out there. This is an own implementation and a challenge for the author to acomplish in his free time.

### Sources

The project will be based on the following sources and products:

## Proposed Schemas :construction:

### ~~Graph Based~~ v0.5

#### ~~Roadmap :rocket:~~

##### ~~Develop a Graph based architecture in which a user can move through nodes.~~

~~1. Create a graph **Graph** 2. Graph has a number of nodes **Node** 3. Nodes have a relationship with other nodes **Relation** 4. User can use this graph and know in which node they are. **Mapping** 5. User can move through nodes **Transition** 6. A node can be of a specific type indicating their behaviour **Generic Node** 7. Node difference an incoming node from an outcoming one. 8. Nodes can have Transition restrictions **Transition** **<---** 9. Tracking path must be saved **History** 10. Graph can have own validations at node transitions~~

### Node Based

#### Roadmap :rocket:

##### Develop a Node based architecture in which a user can move through nodes.

1. Create a node **Node**
2. Nodes have a relationship with other nodes **Relation**
3. User can move through nodes **Transition**
4. User can know in which node they are. **Mapping**
5. A node can be of a specific type indicating their behaviour and stored data **Generic Node**
6. Nodes difference an incoming node from an outcoming one.
7. Nodes can have Transition restrictions **Transition**
8. A Guide must save and provide the transitioned path **History**
